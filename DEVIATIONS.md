## Active Deviations

- Package: `@vue-types/shared`
- Upstream reference: `packages/@react-types/shared` at baseline `1a2b8f860ef2cee6aa579aa6b5e7032ca3be1cb1`
- Difference: Type declarations are currently mirrored from upstream and still include React-centric imports (for example `react` event/ref types).
- Reason: The package was ported as a structural baseline first to unlock dependency order; Vue-specific type mapping has not yet been completed.
- User impact: Consumers may need React type packages for complete type resolution in this package until Vue-native type aliases are introduced.
- Removal plan: Replace React-specific declarations with Vue-native equivalents and compatibility aliases, then remove this entry and set `hasDeviations` to `false`.
