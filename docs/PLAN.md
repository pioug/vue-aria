# PLAN

1. Keep metadata aligned with section and descriptions from reference pages.
2. Fill component pages in batches: core inputs, form controls, overlays, advanced components.
3. Validate package coverage against `@vue-aria`, `@vue-stately`, `@vue-spectrum` directories.
4. Add parity badges and migration notes before publishing.
