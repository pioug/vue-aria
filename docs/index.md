# Vue Aria

Vue Aria is a Vue 3 port of React Aria/React Spectrum with parity-first goals:

- API parity for public modules, functions, and props.
- Behavioral parity for interaction semantics.
- Accessibility parity for keyboard/focus/screen reader support.
- Documentation parity with Vue-first examples.

## Scope

This project ports the current upstream Spectrum version.

`Spectrum S2` (next Spectrum version) is explicitly out of scope unless requested.

- [@vue-aria/interactions](/packages/interactions)
- [@vue-aria/focus](/packages/focus)
