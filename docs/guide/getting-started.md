# Getting started

Use this section as the entry point for the Vue docs and parity workflow.

1. Build docs with `npm run docs:dev`.
1. Fill one package page at a time.
1. Mark each page as complete before release.

## Scope
- React Aria feature pages are mapped by section and description from the reference docs.
- React Spectrum pages are mapped from Spectrum reference taxonomy.
- React Stately pages are adapted and linked to React Aria state references.
